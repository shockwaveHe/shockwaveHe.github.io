I am currently a second-year Master's student at Stanford, working on computer vision and robotics. I work with Prof. [Ehsan Adeli](https://stanford.edu/~eadeli/) and Prof. [Youngjoong Kwon](https://youngjoongunc.github.io/) as part of the [Stanford Translation AI Lab (STAI)](https://stai.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford Vision and Learning (SVL)](https://svl.stanford.edu/). I am also a member of the [Toddlerbot team](https://toddlerbot.github.io/), advised by Prof. [Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/) and Prof. [Karen Liu](https://tml.stanford.edu/).

Previously, I served as a research associate and one of the main engineers at [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/), [CMU Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/). During my time at CMU, I was focusing on building effecient and versatile mobile robot systems that can robustly perceive and safely navigate in unstructured environments. I was also a [2021 CMU Robotics Institute Summer Scholar](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/meet-the-2021-ri-summer-scholars/).
